* Lua

This is [[https://lua.org][Lua]] version 5.4.7, packaged with the [[https://ziglang.org][Zig]] build system.

To build on all targets, run

#+begin_src sh
  zig build
#+end_src

The Zig build system's standard options apply: for example to build in Debug mode,
add =-Doptimize=Debug=. To cross-compile, specify =-Dtarget=.

To use the compiled Lua library from a project using the Zig build system,
you can run

#+begin_src sh
  zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/robbielyman/lua
#+end_src

and then in your =build.zig=, add something like

#+begin_src zig
  const lua_dep = b.dependency("lua", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = opimize,
  });
  const lua_lib = lua_dep.artifact("lua");
#+end_src

* Acknowledgements

This =build.zig= file is heavily indebted to [[https://github.com/natecraddock][@natecraddock]] and [[https://github.com/delta1024][@delta1024]].
It mainly exists to provide a =build.zig= project which correctly compiles the Lua interpreter as =lua=,
so that projects like [[https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks][LuaRocks]] can use it.
